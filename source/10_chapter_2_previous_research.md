## For automatic emotion identification

The affective priming paradigm[@klauer-musch-2003] is known to produce
an effect on reaction times or accuracy for subsequent congruent
emotions, thereby reflecting variability in the processes leading to
affect recognition.[@de-houwer-2009] Many lines of evidence help
extrapolate this fact into the notion that affect identification can
undergo an automatic or preattentional mode:

- Because affective priming occurs only under short stimulus onset
  asynchrony (_SOA_) times[^soa] (300 ms or less), it has been conjectured
  that its processing must occur before the direction of attention and
  response strategies take place.[@moors-de-houwer-2006][@hermans-et-al-2001]

[^soa]: The time lapse between prime and target stimuli presentation.

- Cognitive load (as produced by the simultaneous presentation of
  irrelevant tasks) does not seem to impair affective
  priming.[@hermans-et-al-2000]

- The effect is observed even when the prime is presented at
  unrecognizable subthreshold levels[@draine-greenwald-1998] and
  outside the focus of visual attention[@calvo-nummenmaa-2007].

### Emotion or valence-dependent automatism

A further refinement proposes that not all emotions were created
equally advantageous to recognize. If natural selection produced
complementary high-priority neural circuitry for facial expressions,
one could naturally ask whether this automaticity also primarily
targeted certain life-saving facial expressions. Indeed, a wealth of
research <!-- mention cognitive bias towards type 1 error during
threat detection? --> has found that the priming effect, as well as
others, are biased towards averse and pejorative emotions, as opposed
to happy or neutral
ones.[@fox-et-al-2002][@vuilleumier-2001][@ishai-et-al-2004][@vuilleumier-2005][@susa-et-al-2012]

## Against automatic emotion identification

Contrary to the previous view, Pessoa and colleges
[@pessoa-et-al-2002] interpreted the increased activity in relevant
structures (fusiform area, amygdala, etc.) during explicit attention
to facial features as opposed to inscribed non-expressive details as
evidence that facial processing is contingent upon attention. This
strand of facial emotion processing research is not without more
recent supporters (see [@ochsner-gross-2005][@eimer-et-al-2003] for
instance).

## Perceptual modulation through spare attention: a possible bridging explanation

Seemingly contradictory results stemming from methodologically sound
studies cry for a theoretical reformulation to encompass all the
facts. Research around the conflict often restores to some sort of
interaction and modulation between systems to explain the
data.[@okon-et-al-2007][@palermo-rhodes-2007] Sassi and colleges
proposed that even though emotional perception can be turned
automatic, unused resources might still be consumed in parallel,
should the distracting task not be distracting
enough.[@sassi-et-al-2014]
