# Hypothesis

<!-- current version is formulated as though we only cared about
describing a correlate in order to firmly establish the existence of
the phenomenon, as opposed to assuming it is real and going after the
neural mechanism -->

## Research Question

Are there different modes of facial emotion perception (with or
without attention, valence-dependent)?

## Hypotheses

- Working hypothesis ($H_1$): the putative modes of facial expression
  processing should be correlated to differential spatio-temporal
  activity patterns at associated brain areas.

- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): no significant statistical dependence can
  be found between perception (i.e., processing) of facial expression
  under different conditions and activity patterns in the
  brain.

## Predictions

If the occurrence of "automatic" (i.e. preattentive) or
valence-dependent facial emotion processing goes hand-in-hand with a
neural activity substrate, a powerful-enough statistical method (such
as multivariate classification) should be able to discriminate said
neural activity. This assumes our measurements will be able to capture
the relevant signal.
