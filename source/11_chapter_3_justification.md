## General

<!-- necesita referencias bibliográficas -->

- Despite the initial success of neuroscience identifying and
  describing molecular and cellular underpinnings of many medical and
  psychological phenomena;[^which?] both the methods of
  "small-to-middle-scale" neuroscience and plain _localizationism_
  yield against a number of questions. Many known cognitive
  phenomena[^which?] rather emerge (or are thought to do so) from the
  coordinated physiology of anatomically distributed
  components. Evolutionary constraints pose limits on the number of
  nervous specializations that could univocally correspond to the
  performance of a function, so that certain behavioral and mental
  phenomena must correspond to the differential recruitment and
  modulation of more basic resources at the physiological
  domain.[^gazzaniga] Moreover, modern views on cognition place
  emphasis on the consideration of the interactions of organisms with
  one another and their environment.[^citation-needed] <!-- ;with some
  even postulating that such _grounding_ --> <!-- and _extension_
  processes are inseparable from cognition itself. -->

- Emotions are regarded as some of the most basic wholesale conscious
  experiences; in the sense that they are well-differentiated,
  universally expressive, and inextricably connected to somatic states
  and homeostasis.[@damasio-1998] Helping understand their
  third-person detection and processing contributes to our
  understanding of intersubjectivity, and (hopefully) of subjectivity
  by inclusion.

- As of today, neuroscientists and clinicians are heavily dependent
  upon verbal reports and other behavioral cues to asses mental
  states. More work is needed to help bridge the explanatory gap
  between mechanistic (i.e. physical) facts and subjective
  (i.e. mental) ones.

## Particular

- Alexithymia patients, autism? Possibility of more accurate and
  faster diagnostics, validation among expert knowledge, neuroimaging,
  etc.

- The ongoing debate surrounding the cognitive mechanisms of facial
  expression perception will benefit from extra evidence, and more
  importantly, extra analysis techniques to derive that evidence.[^novelty]

[^novelty]: Is the use of MVPA novel in the facial expression
    recognition literature? Mention if so

- Multivariate and nonlinear methods have proved successful in the
  past extending the identification of more complex brain activity
  interactions which aren't amenable to the traditional regression
  models.

## Methodological justification?

Functional magnetic nuclear resonance is able to record a correlate
signal of local field potentials from wide brain areas, while
providing sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to differentiate
their activity. It is suitable for exploratory studies in which
task-related zones must be first identified, so as to lay the
groundwork for finer-grained measurement techniques.
