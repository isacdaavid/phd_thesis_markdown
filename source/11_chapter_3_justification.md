# Justification

## General

<!-- necesita referencias bibliográficas -->

- Despite the success of neuroscience identifying
  psychologically-relevant molecular, cellular and anatomical
  mechanisms;[^which?] both the methods of "small-to-middle-scale"
  neuroscience and plain _localizationism_ yield against a number of
  psychological questions. Many known cognitive phenomena[^which?]
  rather emerge (or are thought to do so) from the coordinated
  physiology of anatomically distributed modules. Evolutionary
  constraints pose limits on the number of nervous specializations
  that could univocally correspond to the performance of a function,
  so that certain behavioral and mental phenomena must correspond to
  the differential recruitment and modulation of more basic resources
  at the physiological domain. Moreover, modern views on cognition
  place emphasis on the consideration of the interactions of organisms
  with one another and their environment; with some even postulating
  that such _grounding_ and _extension_ processes are inseparable from
  cognition itself.

[^which?]: Which?

- Emotions are regarded as some of the most basic wholesale conscious
  experiences in humans. Understanding their processing contributes to
  our understanding of subjectivity and intersubjectivity.

- As of today, neuroscientists and clinicians are heavily dependent
  upon verbal reports and other behavioral cues to asses mental
  states. More work is needed to help bridge the explanatory gap
  between mechanistic (i.e. physical) facts and subjective
  (i.e. mental) ones.

## Particular

- Alexithymia patients. More accurate and faster diagnostics. (__Did
  Federica filter for alexythimic people on her sample?__)

- The ongoing debate surrounding the cognitive mechanisms of facial
  expression perception will benefit from extra evidence, and more
  importantly, extra analysis techniques to derive that evidence. (__Is
  the use of MVPA novel in the facial expression recognition
  literature? Mention if so.__)

- Multivariate and nonlinear methods have proved successful in the
  past extending the identification of more complex brain activity
  interactions which aren't amenable to the traditional regression
  models.

## Methodological justification?

fMRI recording encompasses very wide areas, usually with sufficient
spatial resolution. It is suitable for exploratory studies in which
relevant brain areas must be first identified so as to lay the
groundwork for finer-grained measurement techniques.
