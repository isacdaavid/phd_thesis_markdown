# Introduction

Emotions are conscious[^conscious] states characterised by their
discreteness, mild-to-marked arousal, hedonistic load[^hedonistic] and
a reference to an organismically relevant somatic state[^somatic]
[@schacter-et-at-2011; @ekman-1994]. Emotions as basic as happiness,
fear, anger and sorrow are probably among the most basic subjective
experiences; and whose behavioral manifestation is traceable to at
least analogous reactions in all living organisms.[^definition]

[^conscious]: By consciousness I am specifically referring to the
    rudimentary meaning of phenomenal consciousness: the quality of
    objects which can feel; in the vein of authors such as Christof
    Koch, David Chalmers, Giulio Tononi and Ned Block.
[^definition]: Some authors use the word "emotion" for the behavioral
    response and reserve the word "feeling" for their
    conscious counterpart.
[^hedonistic]: Unlike, for instance, the (dis)pleasureless experience
            of a vivid color or propioceptive information.
[^somatic]: Unlike, say, the exquisite smell of flowers. @damasio-1996 uses
    the term "somatic" as opposed to "bodily" to convey the
    sufficiency of mental _representations_ of the body.

It is for this very basal nature and the role of the nervous system in
supporting them that emotions not only interfere with and modulate
higher-order cognition, but also provide the most fundamental basis
for motivation, and therefore for planning and behavior
[@schwarz-1990]. Emotions are causally connected to various responses
in the peripheral nervous system (both somatic and autonomic) and
endocrine activity. Memory formation and associative learning can no
longer be understood without the participation of distinct mechanisms
that are emotion-selective [@ledoux-1994].

The predispositions of an individual's emotional dynamics is an often
ignored personality trait. It might seem odd to talk about normally
emerging psycho-physiological states in relation to health; however
their marriage can't be stressed enough. First, emotions themselves
can be symptomatic of illness, as is the case of disgust. More
directly, there's little doubt that affections[^affection] such as
extended depression and phobias should be considered illnesses in
their own right.

[^affection]: Interestingly, the word "affection" can refer to both
    maladies and emotions. Particulartly in psychology, an affect is a
    feeling elicited in response to another feeling or stimulus.

Beyond the individual, there's a special significance to what emotions
can achieve for social well-being. The resulting expressions conveyed
by faces and body language are the epitome of animal communication in
primates. Our ancestors had to read these expressions out and
interpret them, as part of a wider signaling repertoire, well before
the emergence of language proper. Within behavioral ethology a signal
is said to be effective (which implies a reaction in the receiving
organism) if it possesses the property of being evolutionarily
advantageous to both parties, on average. Prevarication detracts from
the value receivers and honest senders obtain from these signals,
making emotions highly effective insofar as they are hard to fake.
Moreover, their adequate perception[^perception] marks an important
input for the mechanisms of the theory of mind,[^theory-of-mind]
emotions being so flagrant a display of visceral mental states.

[^perception]: Perception is the set of interfacing processes by which
    a cognitive system acquires and renders information _from outside
    the system_ useful for attention, planning, reasoning and
    behavior.
[^theory-of-mind]: Theory of mind: attributing mental states to
    others. The belief that other minds exist; opposite to
    solipsism. Not to be conflated with theories of what the mind is.

The psychological literature is committed to discussing the biological
origin and relevance of emotions. An important topic is what I may
call the automatic emotional processing hypothesis: if facial
expression is so important a signal of inner mental states for a
social species like ours, it stands to reason that a cognitive
adaptation could have evolved to decode it separately of visuospatial
attention,[^attention] and perhaps consciousness. Closely related is
the negative-valence bias hypothesis: namely that the aforementioned
shortcut faculty might be biased towards processing certain unpleasant
emotions, since they more often go along life-or-death situations.

[^attention]: Attention refers to the broad psychological faculty of
    filtering out available information. Allocating limited cognitive
    resources.
