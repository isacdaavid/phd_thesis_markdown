# Introduction

Emotions are conscious states characterised by their discreteness,
mild-to-marked arousal, hedonistic load[^hedonistic] and a reference
to a organismically relevant somatic
state.[^somatic][@schacter-et-at-2011][@ekman-1994] Emotions as basic
as happiness, fear, anger and sorrow are probably among the most basic
subjective experiences; and whose behavioral manifestation is
traceable to at least analogous reactions in all living
organisms.[^definition]

[^definition]: Some authors use the word "emotion" for the behavioral
    response and reserve the word "feeling" for their subjectively
    felt counterpart.
[^hedonistic]: Unlike, for instance, the (dis)pleasureless experience
            of a vivid color or propioceptive information.
[^somatic]: Unlike, say, the exquisite smell of
    flowers. [@damasio-1996] uses the term "somatic" as opposed to
    "bodily" to convey the sufficiency of mental bodily _representations_.

It is for this very basal nature and the role of the nervous system in
supporting them that emotions not only interfere with and modulate
higher-order cognition, but also provide the most fundamental basis
for motivation, and therefore planning and behavior.[@schwarz-1990]
Emotions are causally connected to various responses in the peripheral
nervous system (both somatic and autonomic) and endocrine
activity. Memory formation can no longer be understood without the
participation of distinct mechanisms which are
emotion-selective.[@ledoux-1994]

## To Do

- Medical importance of emotion on a personal level: personality,
  extended depression, phobias, other psychiatric conditions?

- Social significance: theory of mind (i.e., other minds, mind-mind
  theory)

   - Faces as the epitome of ecologically relevant emotional
     signaling.

- Evolutionary importance:

   - Automatic emotional processing hypothesis: if facial expression
     is so important a _signal_ of inner mental states for a social
     species like ours, it stands to reason that a cognitive
     adaptation could have evolved to process it separately of
     attention.

   - Negative valence bias hypothesis
