# Sample

- 45 subjects

   - age
   - sex
   - handedness?

- this is our actual experimental sample: 3 fMRI sequences each
  (different contrasts, specify design matrix in [#Materials and
  Methods]())

   - 126 stimulus-response cycles each.
   - __why do NULL (non gazing) cycles have a different "weight" on
     e-prime?__

- Anatomical reference coregistry (some lack sagital T1 FSPGR BRAVO,
  but Axial alternative seems to be good enough to allow for atlas
  transformations).
