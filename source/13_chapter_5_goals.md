# Goals

- Study the biological basis of emotion perception at the bigger scale
  of whole-brain functional networks of neuronal ensambles.

- Dissociate the proposed plethora of phenomena that has been
  traditionally grouped under facial emotion perception. Find and test
  reliable psychological, imaging and computational methods to achieve
  that goal.

- As a natural consequence of the newfound descriptive and explanatory
  power contingent upon the previous point: be able to leverage the
  resulting methods to predict the occurance of distinct emotion
  perception workflows from functional imaging data alone.

- Help settle the debate surrounding the existence of more automatic
  pathways in the processing of emotional imagery, by contributing
  extra evidence coming from a representative and controlled fMRI
  study, as well as rigurous analysis and state-of-the-art pattern
  analysis techniques.
